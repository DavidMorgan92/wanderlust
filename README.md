#### Competitor Research

The following competitor websites will be researched to consider their design choices when offering package holidays:

- Expedia
- TUI
- Jet2Holidays

##### Expedia

Expedia's design, under the "Packages" tab, features a prominent form at the top of the website that requires the user's desired departure and arrival destinations, leaving and returning dates, and number of rooms/guests. A prominent "Search" button initiates the search.

Below this is a list of popular holiday destinations that the user can tap to search holidays with one gesture.

The results are shown as a paged list of cards with a photo, title, rating and price.

Tapping on a result takes the user to a page where they can see more details about the hotel, including local amenities, attractions, and a Google Maps view of the area. From here they can choose a room and go on to book and pay.

##### TUI

TUI's design begins on a selected "Package Holidays" tab. Under this is a prominent form that require's the user's desired departure and arrival destinations, leaving date, desired nights and number of rooms/guests. A prominent "Search" button initiates the search.

Below this is a list of deals based on location, holiday type, or dates. Users can search a list of packages matching these criteria with one gesture.

The results are shown as a list of cards with a photo, title, link to reviews, price, and more details about the hotel and flights.

Tapping on a result takes the user to a page where they can see more details about the hotel, including amenities, attractions, and a Google Maps view of the area. From here they can choose the customize certain details, then go on to book and pay.

##### Jet2Holidays

Jet2Holidays's design features a prominent form at the top of the website that requires the user's desired departure and arrival destinations, leaving date, desired nights and number of rooms/guests. A prominent "Find my holiday" button initiates the search.

Below this is a list of popular holiday destinations that the user can tap to search holidays with one gesture.

The results are shown as a paged list of cards with a photo, title, rating, price and more details about the hotel and flights.

Tapping on a result takes the user to a page where they can see more details about the hotel, including local amenities, attractions, and a Google Maps view of the area. From here they can choose to go on to book and pay.

##### Conclusion

It is clear from looking at competitors' websites that they have a very similar design. This leads me to believe that by trial and error the have converged on a similar design, and that this is what users will expect when they are trying various websites to choose a holiday. Therefore it would be wise to imitate this design.
